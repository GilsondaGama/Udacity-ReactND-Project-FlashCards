**Programming assignment for the [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) program.**

---

# Flashcards
> For the UdaciCards project, you will build a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

Built with React Native, Redux and React Navigation. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app#getting-started).
For this assignment there was no starter template provided (apart from the simple backend API).


## Limitations and things that are missing

The focus of the assignment was on functionality, rather than styling, so I did not spend so much time building the UI (no animations, few loading messages, etc). 
The scope of the assignment was very limited, so it is not possible to edit entries. Also, this project has no automated tests.
